# Responsive Web Design Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository for Responsive Web Design projects! In this repository, you will find a series of projects that I will complete as part of the Responsive Web Design curriculum offered by freeCodeCamp.

## üìå Projects Overview

### 1. üê± Build a Cat Photo App
In this project, I will learn the basics of HTML by building a simple cat photo app. HTML tags provide structure to a webpage. With these tags, I'll add photos, buttons, and other elements to the app.

### 2. ‚òï Build a Cafe Menu
In this project, I will learn basic CSS by designing a menu page for a cafe webpage. CSS tells the browser how to display HTML elements, including setting colors, fonts, sizes, and more.

## üöÄ Upcoming Projects

1. **Modern CSS Techniques**: I'll build a penguin to learn about CSS variables.
2. **Accessibility Best Practices**: I'll create a quiz site to understand best practices for accessibility.
3. **Responsive Web Design**: I'll build a photo gallery with Flexbox and a magazine article layout with CSS Grid to ensure the webpages respond to different screen sizes.

These projects are part of the [freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/).
